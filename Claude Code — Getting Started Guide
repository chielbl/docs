## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an **AI coding assistant that runs in your terminal**. It understands your project, writes code, edits files, runs commands, and helps you build faster — all through natural language.

Think of it as a senior developer sitting next to you:
- You describe what you want → Claude does it
- It reads your files, understands context, and makes changes directly

> 📚 Official docs: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

---

## Installation & First Run

```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Start Claude Code in your project folder
cd your-project
claude
```

On first run, you'll authenticate with your Anthropic account. After that, you're ready to go.

> 📚 Install guide: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/getting-started

---

## Configuration

Claude Code settings work at **three levels** — think of them like layers:

| Level | Scope | File location |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Global** | All your projects | `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| **Project** | One specific project | `your-project/.claude/settings.json` |
| **Local** | Current session only | `settings.local.json` |

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Then use the interactive config command
/config
```

Or edit the JSON files directly.

### Recommended Security Config

Paste this into your `.claude/settings.json` to block Claude from reading sensitive files:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(**/.env)",
      "Read(**/.env.*)",
      "Read(**/secrets/**)",
      "Read(**/config/**)",
      "Read(**/.git/**)",
      "Write(**/.env)",
      "Write(**/.env.*)",
      "Write(**/secrets/**)",
      "Write(**/config/**)",
      "Write(**/.git/**)"
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_HIDE_ACCOUNT_INFO": "1",
    "DISABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING": "1"
  }
}
```

### Performance Config (Optional)

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT": "true",
    "MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS": "8000"
  }
}
```

## Essential Commands

Type these **inside the Claude Code terminal session** (start with `/`):

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/init` | Scans your project and creates/updates `CLAUDE.md` — **always run this first!** |
| `/clear` | Clears the current session context window |
| `/compact` | Summarizes history to reduce context size (run this if things slow down) |
| `/resume` | Shows and continues previous sessions |
| `/context` | Shows what context is currently being sent to Claude |
| `/usage` | View token usage for the active session |
| `/model` | Switch the AI model for the current session |
| `/mcp` | View and manage MCP servers |
| `/permissions` | View or change what Claude is allowed to do |
| `/agents` | Manage your agents |
| `/exit` | Exit Claude Code |
| `/rewind` | Undo the last suggested code change (or press `ESC` twice) |

### Keyboard Shortcut: Plan Mode

Press **`SHIFT + TAB`** to switch to command mode, then:
- `?` — Show all shortcuts
- Enable **Plan Mode** — Claude thinks and plans first, then implements (great for large tasks!)

## How to Write Good Prompts

**The better your prompt, the better the result.** Be specific and outcome-focused.

| ✅ Good prompt | ❌ Bad prompt |
|---|---|
| "Create a TypeScript React hook for debounced search input with 300ms delay" | "Make search work better" |
| "Create a button component that triggers an alert saying 'Hello World'" | "Add a button" |
| "Fix the login form validation — email field should reject non-email formats" | "Fix the form" |

**Tips:**
- Include the tech stack (TypeScript, React, Next.js, etc.)
- Describe the expected behavior, not just the feature
- Reference files with `@filename` — e.g., "Update `@components/Button.tsx` to accept a `disabled` prop"

---

## CLAUDE.md — Your Project Brain

`CLAUDE.md` is a special file at your project root. Claude Code **always reads this file first** to understand your project.

### Create it automatically

```bash
# Inside Claude Code session:
/init
```

This scans your project and generates a `CLAUDE.md` for you.

### What to add at the top

```markdown
# Project Overview

We're building the app described in @SPECS.md. Read that file for general 
architecture, database structure, tech stack, and application decisions.

## Communication Style
Keep replies concise. Focus on key information. No unnecessary fluff.

## Rules
- Always look up official documentation before using third-party libraries.
- Use the DocsExplorer agent for documentation lookup.
- Follow the architecture in @SPECS.md before making structural decisions.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Database: Prisma + PostgreSQL
```

### Advanced additions (after setup)

Once you've set up MCPs, Agents, Skills, and Commands, reference them here so Claude uses them automatically — without you having to ask each time.

---

## MCP — Connect to External Data

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers let Claude access live data: documentation, databases, web content, APIs, and more.

### Install an MCP server

```bash
# Example: context7 — fetches up-to-date library documentation
claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
```

### View installed MCP servers

```bash
# Inside Claude Code session:
/mcp
```

### Popular MCP servers

| MCP | Use case |
|-----|---------|
| `context7` | Fetch live documentation for any library |
| `playwright` | Browser automation and UI testing |
| `github` | Interact with GitHub PRs, issues, repos |
| `filesystem` | Read/write files beyond default scope |

> ⚠️ **Playwright is expensive in tokens** — use it intentionally for automated testing.

> 📚 Popular MCPs: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp

---

## Agents

Agents are **specialized sub-assistants** focused on a specific task (e.g., documentation lookup, code review, API testing).

### Create an agent

```
project/.claude/agents/docs-explorer.md
```

Example content:

```markdown
# DocsExplorer Agent

You are a documentation specialist. When called, look up official documentation 
for any library or framework mentioned. Always use the latest version.
Use context7 MCP to fetch live docs when available.
```

### Add agents in Claude Code

```bash
# Inside Claude Code session:
/agents
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Add the agent to `CLAUDE.md` so Claude uses it automatically.

> 📚 Example agent: https://github.com/academind/claude-code-course-resources/blob/main/code-snapshots/finished-project/CLAUDE.md

---

## Skills

Skills give Claude **extra knowledge** about specific technologies or coding patterns. They can also run code (Python, JavaScript, etc.).

### Create a skill

```
project/.claude/skills/modern-nextjs/SKILL.md
project/.claude/skills/clean-typescript/SKILL.md
```

A skill file contains best practices, conventions, or knowledge Claude should use when working in that domain.

### Add skills in Claude Code

```bash
# Inside Claude Code session:
/skills
```

> 📚 Example skill files:
> - https://github.com/academind/claude-code-course-resources/blob/main/code-snapshots/finished-project/.claude/skills/modern-best-practice-nextjs/SKILL.md
> - https://github.com/academind/claude-code-course-resources/blob/main/code-snapshots/finished-project/.claude/skills/clean-typescript/SKILL.md

---

## Commands (Reusable Prompts)

Commands are **saved prompts** you can trigger anytime without retyping them. Great for repeated tasks like code review, security audit, or changelog generation.

### Create a command

```
project/.claude/commands/code-review.md
```

Example content:

```markdown
Review the code for: $ARGUMENTS

Check for:
- BUGS: Logic errors, edge cases, null handling
- SECURITY: Injection risks, exposed secrets, auth issues
- PERFORMANCE: N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, memory leaks

Be concise. List only real issues with file + line reference.
```

### Use a command

Inside Claude Code, type `/` and select from the list. Then pass arguments like `BUGS`, `SECURITY`, or `PERFORMANCE`.

> 📚 Example command: https://github.com/academind/claude-code-course-resources/blob/main/code-snapshots/finished-project/.claude/commands/code-review.md

---

## Hooks

Hooks **automatically trigger scripts** when Claude takes certain actions — like running a bash command or writing a file.

### Example: Block dangerous `rm` commands

Create the hook script:

```bash
# project/.claude/hooks/block-rm.sh
#!/bin/bash
if echo "$1" | grep -q "rm -rf"; then
  echo "Blocked: rm -rf is not allowed" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/block-rm.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> 📚 Hooks docs: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks

---

## Claude Code on GitHub (PR Reviews)

You can configure Claude to **automatically review Pull Requests** on GitHub using GitHub Actions.

### How it works

1. A PR is opened or updated
2. A GitHub Action triggers Claude Code
3. Claude reviews the diff, adds comments, and optionally approves or requests changes

### Setup steps

**Step 1:** Add your Anthropic API key to GitHub Secrets
```
Settings → Secrets → Actions → New repository secret
Name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

**Step 2:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/claude-review.yml
name: Claude Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Claude Code Review
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

**Step 3:** Claude will now comment on every PR with:
- Bugs and logic issues
- Security concerns
- Code style suggestions
- Improvement ideas

## Claude Code Cloud

**Claude Code Cloud** lets you run Claude Code remotely — no local terminal needed. It's useful for:
- Running Claude on a remote server or CI environment
- Team members without local setup
- Long-running background tasks

### How to use it

1. Go to [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
2. Log in with your Anthropic account
3. Connect your repository (GitHub supported)
4. Start a session — Claude will run in the cloud with access to your repo

### Key differences from local Claude Code

| Feature | Local | Cloud |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Setup | Terminal install | Browser-based |
| File access | Your machine | Connected repo |
| Team sharing | Manual | Built-in |
| CI integration | Via Actions | Native |

## Starting a New Project from Scratch

Follow this workflow for the best results:

### Step 1: Write a project spec

Write a document describing what you're building. Be as detailed as possible:
- What the app does
- Who uses it
- Key features
- Tech stack preferences

> 💡 Use ChatGPT or Claude.ai to refine your spec into a well-structured document.

### Step 2: Create SPECS.md

Save your spec as `SPECS.md` in your project root.

### Step 3: Start Claude Code with your spec

```
We're building an app described in @SPECS.md.
Please format the file as proper markdown and suggest a tech stack.
Then scaffold the initial project structure.
```

### Step 4: Use Plan Mode for large tasks

Press `SHIFT + TAB` → enable **Plan Mode**. Claude will think before acting — essential for complex or multi-file tasks.

### Step 5: Run /init

```bash
/init
```

This generates your `CLAUDE.md` from the project structure.

---

## Best Practices

### 🚀 Getting Started (do these first)

1. Run `/init` immediately after entering a project
2. Configure security permissions in `.claude/settings.json`
3. Add key info to `CLAUDE.md` (tech stack, architecture, rules)
4. Use `/compact` regularly on large codebases to stay fast

### ✍️ Prompting

- Be specific: include tech stack, file names, expected behavior
- Reference files with `@filename`
- Use **Plan Mode** for new features or complex refactors
- Break big tasks into smaller prompts

### 🔒 Security Checklist

- ✅ Deny `.env` and `.env.*` read/write access
- ✅ Block `secrets/` directories
- ✅ Disable telemetry if preferred
- ✅ Review `/context` before sensitive work
- ✅ Never commit `.claude/settings.local.json`

### 🧠 Advanced Setup

Once basics work, layer in:
1. **MCP** — connect to docs, APIs, databases
2. **Agents** — specialized sub-assistants for repeated tasks
3. **Skills** — extra knowledge for your tech stack
4. **Commands** — reusable prompt templates
5. **Hooks** — automated guards and scripts

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Context too large" error | Run `/compact` to summarize history |
| Claude doesn't know your project | Run `/init` to generate `CLAUDE.md` |
| Permission denied on file | Check the `deny` list in `settings.json` |
| Slow or poor responses | Use `/compact` + write more specific prompts |
| Wrong library version used | Add `context7` MCP for live docs |
| Need to undo a change | Type `/rewind` or press `ESC` twice |
